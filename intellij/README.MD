# IntelliJ settings

## Pre requirements

You need to have installed **IntelliJ** on your computer. And *if you want*, **updated to the latest version**. We strongly recommend updating to the latest version to **avoid settings conflicts**.

### Settings installation

Go `File > Import Settings` and browse to `settings.zip` settings zip file. Done!

### Lombok installation

Go `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences...` or press `CMD + ","`. Then, navigate to the `Plugins` tab and search for `Lombok`. That's all! Easy right?
